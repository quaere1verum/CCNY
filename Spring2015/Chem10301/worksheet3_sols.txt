1.) 
A chemical reaction is a process that involves the
rearrangement of the molecular or ionic structure of
a substance, as opposed to a change in physical form
or a nuclear reaction.

What is involved in a chemical reaction?
The substance or substances initially involved in a 
chemical reaction are called reactants or reagents.

What is evidence of a chemical reaction?
The evidence is that they chemical reaction yield one
or more product, which usually have properties different
from the reactants. Reactions often consist of a sequence
of individual sub-steps, the so-called elementary 
reactions.

2.)
Balance the eq.& include the states of the matter:
*** NEED STATE OF MATTER ***

NO + O_2 -> NO_2
2(NO) + O_2 = 2(NO_2)

3.) 
Molarity is the concentration of a solution expressed
as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.
What is the formula for molarity (M)?

Molarity(M) = (moles solute)/ (liters solution) = 
		(number of moles of solute)/(volume of solution)

4.) What is the equation used for solution dilution?
Molarity_ini * Volume_ini = Moolarity_final * Volume_final

5.) 
What's the difference between theoretical yield, percent yield, 
and actual yield?
* Theoretical yield for a reaction is calculated based on the 
limiting reagent.

* Actual yield is the amount of product actually obtained from
a chemical reaction.

* Percent Yield = (actual yield/ theoretical yield ) * 100%

6.) 
Balance the eqs.
a.) SO_3 -> SO_2 + O_2
 ...

7.) In an experiment 0.689 g Cr(s) reacts completely with 
0.636 g 0_2 (g) to form a single solid compound. Write a balanced 
chemical equation for the reaction.
