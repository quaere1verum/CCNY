* Lossles/lossy compression

Run length encoding .- stat redundancy: condition for any to be working
DPCM: predictive coding (Bayesian coding method)
best/optimal encoding strategy.
difference consumes much smaller space/bandwith

arithmetic compression: king of all 

entropic encoding >> huffman/shannon

1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 .... 0 1 1 1 1 1

fax transmittal: 
boolean:
exploit redundancy: 255 bits in 8 bits: 255/8 > 30 dramatic

count number of run

Lossless vs. lossy compression: 
lossless every bit remains after uncompressed.
lossy reduces file byy eliminating redundant  info

//=====================
On test
1.Bayesian question:
formula

2.)  coding based on proof median/mean reasoning


3.) coding <15 lines 
//====================
RLE 

for int i =1 <n i ++
	if cur val == A[i] && count <256
 		count++
	else
		curval = A[i]
		cout <<"curr val count<<
		count = 1

cout << count << endl


// for image recognition
matlab: image processing toolbox
python: scikit-image 


histogram 
count number of occurrences of every
gray scale value in a image


increasing contrast in image
find in matlab min and max
say I is image matrix
min(I(:))

I = double(I)
I = ((I-74)/(224-74))*255
74 is min 
224 is max 
I = ((I - min)/(max-min))*255

as rubber band histogram
