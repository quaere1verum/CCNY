* Overviews last class
#   I = ( (I - min)/(max - min) ) * 255

* History stretching method: rubber band
Contrast enhancement


* Pepper noise  
I[1][1] = 0 // black pepper
I [2][1] = 255 // white pepper

* change format of numbers on division I / ...
turn it into a doubles

* Equalization idea to solve 
  outlier problems in image 

* Signal vs. noise
alg: general/too specific to solve one 
case useless

* Histogram equalization( Best way to improve image contrast)
ideal histogram 
y

_________________________ x


w*h/256 = dream height for amplidtuudes on bimodal histograms
, w = width
, h is height 


* Use idea of image equalization as 
if histogram 
| |  	       ||
| |            ||

* otsu method AKA gray thresh in matlab
  find value based on weights
  w1*var1 + w2*var2

  otsu method useles if there are varying illumination
  lighting source.

  adaptive thresholding == call otsu on each square

* compare binary images automatically
  compute: area sum 1's 
      	   boundary length: 1 pixel with adjacent 0s 
Area and L 
	A = pi* r^2
	L = 2*pi * r
	compactness : geometric index of shape
