* redundancy root cause of compression

* image: spatial redundancy
2 given pixels 

* Insert redundancy to tolerate errors

* Shannon:
Information theory
communication theory

Compression, lowest bound is the entropy

* Difference Pause Coding Method (DPCM)
Idea, we have a sequence  
100 100 100 101 99 97 101 200 201 203 204
1byte for each val we need 10 bytes 

reduce number of bits to represent
100	100 	100	101 	99 	97	101  	200 201	203
100	0	0	1	-2	-2	4 	99  1 	2 

0 order DPCM, use previous value as a constant for next value

get two previous values, we can get linear regression.
